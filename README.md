# How to use it?
1. Enter bans starting with both attackers then defenders. !Names must start with a capital letter and use no special characters!
2. Enter the number of players then enter player names
3. Enter what side you are on ('atk' or 'def')
## Features
- If a name is mistyped the program will return suggested similar names
- There is an internal counter; after the 4th round it will ask you if you want to start a new game.
- You can enter new bans after starting a new game
- You can enter a new player count after starting a new game
### Roadmap
- Adding an option that does not require the input of operator bans
- Adding a GUI
